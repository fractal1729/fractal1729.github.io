<p>Hi! My name is Vinjai Vale. I recently joined a stealth AI startup in San Francisco to lead product engineering. I previously led the AI Acceleration team at Watershed, where I helped architect the AI-native future of the company, building internal AI agents to accelerate our employees and an agentic platform in our product to serve customers.</p>
	
<p>I obtained a BS in math and masters in AI at Stanford, graduating in June 2022. My research interests included deep generative models, value-aligned artificial intelligence, and existential risks to humanity. At Stanford, I revived the ACM club and turned it into the largest CS organization on campus, and co-founded the <a href='https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/stanford-existential-risks-initiative'>Stanford Existential Risks Initiative</a>.</p>
	
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy writing puzzle hunts, bouldering, experimenting with new recipes, and playing StarCraft II.</p>

<h3>Recent work</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.watershed.com">Watershed</a> (2022-2025): full-stack product engineering -> AI chief of staff. Built 100+ agents serving all of our employees and contractors, and helped create the infrastructure for AI agents to serve customers in our product. I also built our university recruiting program, designing our hiring profile and interview pipeline and serving as primary hiring manager for the 2025 new grads and interns. Watershed builds the operating system for the climate economy, with ~2% (and growing) of all global GHG emissions under management.

<h3>High school</h3>

<p>Graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 2018, where I was recognized with the Faculty Prize for Academic Excellence for holding the first rank.</p>

<p>Competed in the 2017 Regeneron Science Talent Search, where I finished in 7th place. Read my <a href='stspaper.pdf'>paper</a>.</p>

<p>Founded the Phillips Exeter Academy Puzzle Hunt and led the effort to organize three annual 48-hour hunts. See our <a href='https://www.peapuzzlehunt.com/previous-hunt'>puzzles</a> and this <a href='https://www.exeter.edu/news/riddle-me'>article</a>. The hunt has become a school tradition and is now on its sixth year.</p>

<p>Many years ago I was active in math competitions. I won first place in the 2015 USA Junior Math Olympiad and went to the Math Olympiad Summer Program. I also wrote a book, <i>111 Problems in Algebra and Number Theory</i>, for aspiring Olympiad contestants.
