<p>My name is Vinjai Vale. I am pursuing a math major and CS masters at Stanford (expected graduation June 2022). You can contact me at [firstname]@stanford.edu.</p> My research interests include deep generative models, value-aligned development/application of artificial intelligence, and existential risks. I am a Co-President of the Stanford chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery, and am on the founding team of the Stanford Existential Risks Initiative. I will be co-directing the SERI Summer 2020 undergraudate research program. I enjoy ultimate frisbee, rock-climbing, and StarCraft II.

<h3>Projects</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		CS 236 final project: introduced methods to learn multiple orderings simultaneously in autoregressive models, and demonstrated that this leads to better inpainting results and sub-linear inference time. Read our <a href='farm.pdf'>paper</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		CS 166 final project: explored dynamic optimality and analyzed the tango tree data structure in theory and practice. Read our <a href='tango.pdf'>paper</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Placed second in the 2020 <a href='https://www.battlecode.org'>MIT Battlecode</a> competition, and won first place in 2019, with team <b>smite</b>.

<h3>High school</h3>

<p>Graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 2018, where I was recognized with the Faculty Prize for Academic Excellence for holding the first rank.</p>

<p>Competed in the 2017 Regeneron Science Talent Search, where I won 7th place. Read my <a href='stspaper.pdf'>paper</a>.</p>

<p>Founded the Phillips Exeter Academy Puzzle Hunt and led the effort to organize three annual 48-hour hunts. See our <a href='https://www.peapuzzlehunt.com/previous-hunt'>puzzles</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier in high school I was active in math competitions. I won the 2015 USA Junior Math Olympiad and went to the Math Olympiad Summer Program. I also wrote a book, <i>111 Problems in Algebra and Number Theory</i>, for aspiring Olympiad contestants.
